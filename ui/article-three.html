        <p>
           Education in India is provided by the public sector as well as the private sector, with control and funding coming from three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children between the ages of 6 and 14. The ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.

        India has made progress in terms of increasing the primary education attendance rate and expanding literacy to approximately three-quarters of the population in the 7â€“10 age group, by 2011.[3] India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[4] Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrolment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrolment Ratio of 24% in 2013,[5] there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations,[6] a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.
