        El Clásico (Spanish pronunciation: [el ˈklasiko]; Catalan: El Clàssic,[1] pronounced [əɫ ˈkɫasik]; "The Classic") is the name given in football to any match between fierce rivals Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. Originally it referred only to those competitions held in the Spanish championship, but nowadays the term has been generalized, and tends to include every single match between the two clubs: UEFA Champions League, Copa del Rey, etc. Other than the UEFA Champions League Final, it is considered one of the biggest club football games in the world, and is among the most viewed annual sporting events.[2][3][4] The match is known for its intensity.
